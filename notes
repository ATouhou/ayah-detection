settings: (110 line height, 87 max pixels, false for use transparency)
- the header for the next sura takes up two lines
- the basmalla takes up one line
- so for each sura split, skip 3 lines, except for sura tawba, skip 2.
- care must be taken for pages like 519 and 520, which end in a header (and
  the actual basmala is on the next page, so it needs to be skipped there).
# TODO: need to shift all the files down by 1 (sura fatiha is currently page 2)
# TODO: the last line of page 467 needs to be manually added
