# TODO: sometimes, midpoint is not the best algorithm. can we do better?

========
settings: (110 line height, 50 max pixels, false for use transparency)
- pages with more than one sura detect less lines.
- the header for the next sura takes up one line (really 2, but only one is
  detected with the current settings)
- the basmalla takes up one line
- so for each sura split, skip 2 lines, except for sura tawba, skip 1.
- care must be taken for pages like 519 and 520, which end in a header (and
  the actual basmala is on the next page, so it needs to be skipped there).
# TODO: need to shift all the files down by 1 (sura fatiha is currently page 2)
# figure out why pages are wrong - 13 lines for page 318, for example

settings: (100 line height, 35 max pixels, false for use transparency)
- each sura split header is one line, and each basmala is one line

- page 294, 385 don't work (crashes) -- done
